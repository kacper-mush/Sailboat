# Sailboat - a simple geometric game

This is a project sparked by a simple conversation with my high school math teacher, about being able to replace all the classic transformations like rotation and translation
by just reflections. This game happens to be just that - your goal is to overlap a randomly placed sailboat with its destination using only reflections. Using the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem
we can say that you need at most 3 reflections to do so. Will you be able to?
In order to play this game you need to install pygame as a dependency to this project like this:

`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

with the requirements file provided in the repo.
Also, you can play a slightly different version of this game here:

It is in Polish but it shouldn't be a problem as the controls are really simple. Have fun!
